# My Ideology

The web is the greatest invention up to this point in time. The ability to access the worlds knowledge and share culture is astounding. It is a new frontier that has only just started. It also acts as a new medium for us to tell stories. Which I believe we have just begun to scratch the surface of. 

# Individual Contributor

As an individual contributor I get excited about technologies which let us continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with the web. Currently I am very excited about the Progressive Web App (PWA) set of technologies. Allowing for more access to people with limited network capabilites. Providing native like experience, helping to disrupt the app store duopoly. Continuing the web being the greatest mechanism for dissemination of information. 

# Management Style

I have been a programmer longer than I have been a manager, so far. As such I'm actively learning, developing and honing my style. A few things that I know are a core part of who I am which will naturally translate into my management are; empathy, ownership and allowing room for dissent.

# About Me

I am originally from San Diego, California, USA and currently live in Portland, Oregon, USA. As an introvert, social interactions drain me, even if I am having a great time. I need ample self time to recharge. One of the favorite ways to do so is being alone in nature and riding long stretches of road on my motorcycle.
