# My Idealogy

The web is the greatest human invention up to this point in time. The ability to access the worlds knowledge and share culture is outstounding. It's a new frontier that has only just started. 

It also acts as a new medium for us to tell stories. Which I believe we haven't even begun to scratch the surface of. 

# Individual Contributor

As an individual contributor I get excited about technolgies which let us continue to push the boundaries of what's possible with the web. Currently I'm very excited about the Progressive Web App (PWA) set of technoglies. These allow for more access to people with limited network capabilites. Can provide native like experience helping to distupt the app store duopoly. Continuing the web being the greatest mechanism for dissmenation of information. 

# Management Style

My tenure as a manager so far has been far less in comparison of my career as a programmer. As such I'm actively learning, developing and honing my style. A few things that I know are a core part of who I am which will naturally translate into my management are; empathy, ownership and allowing room for dissent.

# About Me

I am originally from San Diego, California, USA and currenlty live in Portland, Oregon, USA. As an introvert, social interactions drain me, even if I'm having a great time. I need ample self time to recharge. One of the favorite was to do so is being alone in nature and riding long stretches of road on my motorcycle.
